## Shell ##
# Initialization:
    1. Shell reads the file "config.gsh" in main configuration directory to retreive
    basic configuration
    2. Shell reads the file "init.gsh" in main configuration directory to do what
        user wanna to do at startup

# Paths:
        Standard modules paths:
            "/lib/gsh/modules"

        Configuration paths:
            "/etc/gsh/"
            - Main configuration directory of "gsh" for all users
            "~/.gsh/" - Main configuration directory of "gsh" for each user

# Bindings:
                You can bind ANY key in shell

            Example :
                @import shell

                shell.bind_key("q", exit)

# Use example:
                    $ >> a
                      [!] "a" is not defined
                      $ >> function f(a, b)
                {
                    return a * b
                }
$ >> f(4, 7)
  28
  $ >> import "math"
  $ >> math.sin = "qwe"
                  [!] Module "math" is not changable
