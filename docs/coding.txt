This file describes how you should code this project

All data structures that you create should have
- initialization function
- deinitialization function
- dynamic allocation function

Init function:
Assumptions:
struct is not initialized
        Required arguments:
        pointer to a data structure to init
        Actions:
        should set "initialized" property of the struct to true
            set all values to defaultReturns nothing

            De - init function:
            Assumptions:
            struct is initialized
                Required arguments:
                pointer to a data structure to deinit
                Actions:
                should set "initialized" property of the struct to false
                    set all values to defaultShouldn't:
                    deallocate the given pointer
                    Returns nothing

                    Dynamic allocation function:
                    Takes no arguments
                    Returns pointer to a newly allocated thing


Something another:
    Each function should have DEV_ASSERT() calls at the beginning
    for the invalid arguments
