Thinking

## What name the project should have?

Well, since this is an educational project...

The problem is, if I were to name it something like
"Educational Interpreter written in C", it would be
too ugly.

Well, ok, in order to select the name, I should think first about
what this project actually relates to.

The name should be abstract since this project is the language/interpreter.

Xesael would be a good name. I've made it from the word "Weasel". Weasels are
very cute.
