The Xesael Project
==================

## Description
I wrote this project in order to better understand how programming languages work.
This is an interpreted language, consiting of a lexer, parser, byte-code generator (compiler),
and a virtual machine that executes the byte code.

Only UNIX systems are supported.

## Build
In order to build the project you have to:
1). Genererate source file dependencies using `scripts/build_deps.sh`.
2). Execute `scripts/build.sh` in order to actually compile the project.
